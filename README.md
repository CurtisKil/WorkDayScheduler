# WorkDayScheduler
  This application is a simple calander that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This run's in the 
browser and feature's dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript. In addition the app display's standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) along the left hand side of each input row. Depending on the time of day, the schedule input feilds update their color indicating to the user wether items are in the past, present or future.

# Motivation
  I wanted to create a web application for a user who wanted a simple work day scheduelr that they could use every day.
